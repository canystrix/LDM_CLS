The foundation of Deutsche Bahn AG Deutsche Bahn AG is a young company and was founded as a joint stock company in January 1994
It represents the start of a new age in railway history, with two state-run railways now combined into one privately-run company
The foundation of Deutsche Bahn AG was the political and economic response to two very different challenges in the last decade of the 20th century
The more pleasant one to begin with: as a result of the Monday demonstrations in Leipzig against the unwillingness and inability of the government of the GDR to accept and bring about change through reform, the soft revolution achieved success in East Germany in 1989, as it had earlier in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia
This was the basis for political reunification of a once divided Germany and also for the reuniting of two railway systems and railway companies that had been divided by the Iron Curtain
Although the political reunification of the two German states had taken place unbelievably quickly, the alignment of two economic systems remains a constant challenge
From the point of view of the railways, the main problem was the extremely poor technical condition of the railway system in the GDR
While there had been precious little investment in the railway network in the former West, it seemed in some places as if time had stood still for the Reichsbahn
Bundesbahn and Reichsbahn Compared to West Germany, the rail network in the GDR was much more dense
However, in 1990, only 30 percent (3,829 km) of the network was electrified and less than one third of the entire network had more than one track
On the other hand, 45 percent (11,700 km) of the network of the Bundesbahn was electrified and almost 46 percent (12,300 km) had more than one track
In addition, the Reichsbahn infrastructure was out-of-date, with 67 percent of the signal boxes over 40 years old and 35 percent of the 8,224 bridges and viaducts in excess of 100 years old
Restrictions on maximum speed, on the permissible axle load and sections with a temporary speed restriction made operations difficult
In many cases, points and signal boxes were still operated by hand
The outdated network system that was subject to the dictates of the planned economy, however, chalked up twice as many kilometres per passenger a year than its West German counterpart
Accordingly, there was more wear and as a result a higher capital expenditure requirement
The Reichsbahn furthermore was severely overstaffed – as was the case in almost every state-run company in the GDR
In 1990, there was a workforce of 253,000 employees for a network that was half of the size and operated half of the number of trains as the Bundesbahn
That same year, Deutsche Bundesbahn employed 236,000 public officials, employees and workers
The urgent need for reform The situation for the Bundesbahn was also dramatic
Competition from road transport and increasingly from the airlines resulted in rail drastically losing its share of the market in terms of the overall traffic volume
Despite decreasing personnel costs and increasing revenues, the state-run company that was managed like a local authority made losses in the 80s that were cause for some concern
Debts following reunification stood at DM 44 billion
Since 1950, each new government had repeatedly set up commissions to find a way out of the Bundesbahn's financial dilemma
None of these reform commissions produced any long-term success
Shortly before the unexpected events in the GDR, both the West German government and the Bundesbahn itself were convinced that the state-run railway authority in its antiquated form had no future
In July 1989, therefore, a Bundesbahn commission was set up by the government to submit a reform plan that would release the government from the Bundesbahn as a budgetary risk and make rail future-compliant again as a mode of transport in a growing single European market
The response to these challenges in the 90s were the same everywhere: deregulation while introducing new legal requirements that would make market-driven, cost-conscious management possible and inevitable
To this was added the possibility of establishing a freely negotiable pricing system and using the lines in accordance with the profit-making principles of a business enterprise
Deutsche Bahn was to earn its money in the marketplace and not pick it up in parliament
 Whether it would have been possible to push through such a fundamental reform without the changed political conditions that prevailed in West Germany in 1989 will remain unanswered
On the other, there is no doubt that it would have been impossible for any government to have ignored the need for reform following reunification
This is the only way to understand why a parliamentary majority in the Bundestag approved an amendment to the constitution and to a whole package of legislative amendments on 2 December 1993
With 559 votes in favour, 12 against and 4 abstentions, the Bundestag cleared the way for a fundamental reform of the railways
After the Bundesrat had approved the reform with the necessary two thirds majority, it was possible to enter Deutsche Bahn AG in the commercial register of Berlin in January 1994
This was the end for the two state-run rail companies, each of which had had its own special character: the state-run Bundesbahn and the Reichsbahn owned by a socialist government are now history
