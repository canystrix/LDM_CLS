The foundation of Deutsche Bahn AG was the political and economic response to two very different challenges in the last decade of the 20th century. The more pleasant one to begin with: as a result of the Monday demonstrations in Leipzig against the unwillingness and inability of the government of the GDR to accept and bring about change through reform, the soft revolution achieved success in East Germany in 1989, as it had earlier in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
This was the basis for political reunification of a once divided Germany and also for the reuniting of two railway systems and railway companies that had been divided by the Iron Curtain. Although the political reunification of the two German states had taken place unbelievably quickly, the alignment of two economic systems remains a constant challenge. From the point of view of the railways, the main problem was the extremely poor technical condition of the railway system in the GDR. While there had been precious little investment in the railway network in the former West, it seemed in some places as if time had stood still for the Reichsbahn.
