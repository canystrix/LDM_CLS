# *** LEVEL 1 - FUNCTIONS *** #
# Here you will find several tasks related to writing and calling functions.

sample_string = "Loctimize is a market-leading expert for language logistics."
sample_int_1 = 50
sample_int_2 = 500


# TASK 1
# Write a function that takes two positional arguments.
# Both arguments should be of datatype int!
# The function should calculate the sum of the two positional arguments and return it
# e.g. sum = a + b
# Save the return value of the function to a separate variable and print it!
# Call the function by passing sample_int_1 and sample_int_2 to it as arguments.

def function(arg):
    pass

print()


# TASK 2
# Write a function that takes one positional argument and one keyworded argument.
# The positional argument should be a string.
# The keyworded argument should have the data type int with a default value of 100.
# The function should get the character length of the string passed as positional argument.
# It should then compare it to the integer passed to the function as keyworded argument.
# If the length of the string is smaller than the integer passed as keyworded argument, return True.
# If the length of the string is greater than the integer passed as keyworded argument, return False.
# Call the function twice:
# Once omitting the keyworded argument
# Once using sample_int_2 as the keyworded argument
