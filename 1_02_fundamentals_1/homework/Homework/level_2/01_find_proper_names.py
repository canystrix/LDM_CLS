# *** LEVEL 2 - FIND PROPER NAMES *** #

# There is one sample TXT file located in this directory
# Read the contents of sample.txt as a string or list of paragraphs
# Then iterate over each word in the file
# Check for each word whether it starts with an uppercase letter. If it does, add it to name_set
# TIP: There is a string method for checking if a word is uppercase!
# Save the contents of name_set to a new file!
# Each item in name_set should be displayed on a new line in the final file

# TODO: Write your code here! Feel free to delete this comment!
