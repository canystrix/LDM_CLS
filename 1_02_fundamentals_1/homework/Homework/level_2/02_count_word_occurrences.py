# *** LEVEL 2 - COUNT WORD OCCURRENCES *** #

# There is one sample TXT file located in this directory.
# Read the contents of sample1.txt as a string or list of paragraphs.
# Write a function to iterate over the contents of sample1.txt and count the occurrence of each word in the document.
# Save each individual word and the number of its occurrences in the text to a dictionary!
#
# e.g. if the word "hello" is found twice in the text and the word "goodbye" is found once
# Then the final dictionary should look like this:
# word_occurrence = {"hello":2, "goodbye":1}
#
# Write that dictionary to a new file named sample_words.csv
# The first line of the final file should be a header containing only "Word" and "Occurrences"
# Each of the key-value pairs in word_occurrences should be printed to a new line in the final file.
#
# The final file structure should look like this:
# Words     Occurrences
# hello     2
# goodbye   1

# TODO: Write your code here! Feel free to delete this comment!

word_occurrence = dict()
